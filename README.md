# Computation-of-Rainfall-Attenuation
This is a reproducible script for calculating rainfall attenuation for earth to space communication links using ITU-R P.618-8 Model. It gives flexibility in imputing rain rate data from ITU-R P.837-7 or other sources such as raingauge and satellite measurements.
